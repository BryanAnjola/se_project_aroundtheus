**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

worked a lot with grid and media querys and learned how to use them to affectively make sites compatible with desktop and mobile phones/tablets on vs code.
